#### Instructions

##### 1. Prepare the Base:
- In a large pot, bring the **crushed rice** and 4 cups of water to a gentle boil.

- Add the pre-cooked chickpeas and pinto beans to the pot. Mix well.

##### 3. Add Herbs:
- Stir in the chopped herbs (**sabzi ashi**) and **spinach**.
- Let the mixture simmer for about 20-30 minutes until the herbs are tender.

##### 4. Add Broth, Yogurt, and Whey:
- Slowly pour in the **beef bone broth (ab ghalam)** while stirring.
- Add the **tangy yogurt (doogh)** and **whey (kashk)** gradually, ensuring it mixes evenly.

##### 5. Add Noodles:
- Break the **ash noodles (reshteh ashi)** into smaller pieces if needed and add them to the pot.
- Stir gently and let the soup simmer until the noodles are fully cooked.

##### 6. Final Seasoning and Toppings:
- Add **black pepper**, salt, and the **sour orange juice (ab narenj)**. Adjust the seasoning to your taste.
- Top the soup with **fried onions (piaz dagh)** and **fried garlic (sir dagh)** for extra flavor.

##### 7. Garnish:
- Just before serving, sprinkle a handful of **fresh herbs** over the soup for a vibrant finish.

#### Serving:
- Serve Ash Kashk hot in bowls, and enjoy with additional kashk drizzled on top if desired.

#### Tips:
- If you prefer a thicker soup, let it simmer longer to reduce the liquid.
- Adjust the sourness by adding more or less **doogh** or **ab narenj** based on your taste.
- You can prepare the fried onions and garlic in advance and store them for quick use in various Persian dishes.
