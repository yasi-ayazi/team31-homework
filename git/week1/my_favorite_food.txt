#### Instructions

##### 1. Prepare the Beans:
- If using dried beans, soak them overnight in cold water.
- Rinse and boil the beans in water until halfway cooked. Set aside.

##### 2. Prepare the Herbs:
- Heat 2-3 tbsp oil in a large pan.
- Add the chopped herbs (parsley, cilantro, fenugreek, and optional spinach). Sauté over medium heat for 10-15 minutes until the herbs darken and release a strong aroma. Be careful not to burn them.

##### 3. Prepare the Meat:
- Heat oil in a large pot.
- Sauté the chopped onion until golden.
- Add the meat and turmeric, and stir until the meat is lightly browned on all sides.

##### 4. Combine Ingredients:
- Add the sautéed herbs to the meat mixture and stir.
- Pour in 4-5 cups of water (or beef stock). Bring to a boil.

##### 5. Add Beans and Dried Limes:
- Add the pre-cooked beans to the pot.
- Pierce the dried limes with a fork or knife and add them to the stew. (This helps release their tangy flavor.)
- Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer gently for 2-3 hours, stirring occasionally.

##### 6. Season the Stew:
- After 2 hours, check the stew for flavor and texture.
- Add salt, black pepper, and more turmeric if needed.
- Simmer until the meat and beans are tender, and the stew has thickened.

#### Serving:
- Serve **Ghorme Sabzi** hot with steamed basmati rice, ideally prepared with saffron.

#### Tips:
- For a deeper flavor, some people add a little lemon juice or a pinch of ground dried lime at the end.
- If fresh herbs are not available, you can use dried herbs, but fresh is preferred for the best taste.
- Make sure the stew simmers slowly, as this enhances the flavor.
